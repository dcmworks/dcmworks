Ever since I can remember, the others had made fun of me. They were relentless with their teasing, telling me I couldn’t do anything because I was too young, too weak. The bigger Gengar would gang up on me – they would hide in the shadows and wait until I had fallen asleep before pouncing on me, spikes and all. I put up with it because I figured it had to stop at some point. They would find someone else to bother and leave me in peace. And eventually they did, but not in the way I had ever imagined.  
<br /><br />
My pack liked to travel. They were adventurous, a sentiment I didn’t exactly share. I’d lived in the woods, in ice caves, dilapidated cities. One of my favourite places we visited was a little town that seemed quaint and quiet. I think it was called New Oak Town, or Bark or something associated with trees. I prefer cities and towns to the forest – there are more places to hide, more spaces to call your own. Nooks and crannies in old stone and brick were so much more interesting than a hole in a tree or an alcove under a riverbed. And it was in this unassuming little town that we found Mother. Or maybe she found us… I’m not sure. 
<br /><br />
None of us ever saw her, but she was always there, talking to us, taking care of us. It seemed like she’d always been there, even though we knew that hadn’t been the case. She sounded like a human, even though she didn’t really feel like one. Mother said I was special, talented. She said I had great potential, and I shouldn’t listen to what everyone else said. They were just jealous. They saw that I could be better than them, and that scared them. That was why they made fun of me. Mother said she could help me show them I was better than them, and I did. Oh, the fun I had doing it, too. 
<br /><br />
I’d always liked playing with human minds. They were so much more interesting than animal minds or even other Pokemon minds. So much more complicated – they were like puzzles. Mazes, even. I could hide in a human mind for days if I was really careful. Best of all, it was my own private space. No one could get to me while I was exploring the twists and tangles of my captive human. 
<br /><br />
Mother was impressed with my skill. She said she could teach me, make me better and stronger. In time and in turn, they would fear me. If I used my power to its full potential, I might even be lord of them all. I liked that word – lord. It sounded powerful. Full of richness and strength. Little did I know it was just another maze, one created by humans to trap and hurt others with. But I believed her then, and I think perhaps a small part of me still believes her now. 
<br /><br />
Mother invented a game for us – a race of sorts. She would point out a series of humans for each of us, and we would either have to take the tangles and knot them even further, or unpick the tangles so they turned into one long, round piece of string. Some days we spent hours racing, but I was never tired. It was exhilarating, diving from mind to mind, and sometimes I got to see through the human’s eyes while I worked my magic. It was interesting, but I could never handle it for too long. Human eyes were so slow, so unresponsive. 
<br /><br />
Sometimes I had reservations. I would win my race – I always did, and look back on my conquest (another word Mother taught us). There was always a lot of blood, in puddles or dots or streamers. Blood didn’t bother me, but it was the reactions on the humans’ faces that sometimes made me stop and wonder. They seemed dazed, almost disoriented. At first I thought it was just because of their unresponsive eyes, but as time went on I learned that there might be more to it all than I suspected. I never found out, of course, but sometimes I still wonder. What exactly did we do to them? Why was our concept of fun also not theirs? I wanted to ask Mother – she would be sure to know. But somehow I also knew she would never give me the real answer. She would just tell me whatever she thought I wanted to hear. 
<br /><br />
There was always one human Mother never pointed out to us. I asked her about it once, and she just chuckled to herself. He didn’t seem anything special. He might have been taller, and slightly moodier than all the others, but there was nothing about him that really stood out. The other humans seemed to go out of their way to avoid him, though, so I thought he might be dangerous. Maybe Mother didn’t want to risk hurting us against the human. Of course, I never found out the true reason she wanted us to steer clear of him. 
<br /><br />
So we proceeded with our days, running races (heaps and heaps of them!) under Mother’s guidance and encouragement. After the others saw how good I was, they began to soften up to me, trying to figure out the secrets of my ways. I never let up, of course – not that there was much to say. The tangles were easy for me. Sometimes I loitered a bit, taking my time with them, caressing them lovingly before moving on. 
<br /><br />
But one day, Mother just disappeared. I’d gotten so used to her voice in my head, guiding and encouraging me, that it took me the best part of a day to figure out why I felt so light headed and… just strange. A good number of us spent the best part of the next year trying to find her, but it ended up being a waste of our time. She would come back – surely she would, we all said. I’m not so sure now, but I know some of the others still hold out hope. 
<br /><br />
And so that’s that. My pack is still travelling. I’d be willing to bet we’ve travelled longer and further than any other pack out there. Sometimes we run into other packs that have met Mother before and we get a little bit excited – but the stories are always the same. All I know is that she’s never visited the same pack twice. Whatever her reasons or her whereabouts, I just want to be able to talk to her again. To make her answer all the questions that have been plaguing me for all these years. If she really is a human, I’ll tangle her up like I did all those others. I’ve been practising, too. I just hope it’s worth it.
