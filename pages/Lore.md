Test for Lore setup.



Banner goes here, like this one:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/OQFYPhC.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com"/>
With "First Incursion" as the title written ontop of it, with four of these banners on the page as paralax. When you click on the banner/image, it expands to reveal the content for the lore item.

I did a quick sketch so you can see what i mean:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/S1GDUwI.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" />

Not sure if the collapsable thing is doable, if it's not, then is the layout doable with the images paralax?
