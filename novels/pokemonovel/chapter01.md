Three raps sounded on my door. I had been reclining in my chair when she arrived, reading a dusty paperback. I glanced at the door, briefly entertaining the possibility of hiding under my desk until the customer left. It was then I noticed the power bill tucked against my monitor and remembered I needed the money. I called the customer in and wasn’t surprised to see an old acquaintance - I’d helped find her Eevee a few months ago. It’d been an easy job and I’d been glad for her patronage, so I found myself pleased at her return.

“Hello, Mister Hendricks.”

“Heya, Miss Bartlett, if I recall?” She nodded.

“How’s your young Eevee? Well, I hope?” She nodded again.

“I’m glad, what can I do for you today?” She stood there like a stunned Magikarp, and I realised I was being rude.

“Oh, please have a seat.” I gestured to the chair on the far side of my desk, and I fiddled with papers on my desk until she sat.

I observed her properly for the first time. She wore a deep purple skirt, a sharp blouse and a thin jacket. It was a good look on her early-thirties body, smart yet comfortable. She was about my age, and I have to say, she was damn fine.

“So, Miss Bartlett, what can I do for you?” I clicked a pen absently, notepad open, ready to jot down anything she might have to say.

She hesitated and produced a photo from her purse. A snap of a healthy Squirtle, its only noticeable features a scar on its right bicep and a chip in its shell.

“That’s the Squirtle from my street, and it went missing two days ago. I called the police but they wouldn’t help, and they said were sending a new one, but it hasn’t showed up, and when I called they said it wasn’t on file.” I jotted her words down, my brain already ticking over. “So I came to you. I didn’t know what else to do.” She hesitated, then started to say something else, but I raised my finger to stop her.

It’s hard to explain in simple terms, but I’ll do my best. This Squirtle worked in the substation beneath Miss Bartlett’s street, providing the people living along the street with fresh water. It would take more than a few words to explain how the various water types operate in a network, but suffice to say the missing Squirtle wouldn’t be missed by anyone but Miss Bartlett’s neighbours. I realised I’d written all this down as well. It’s always good to put down your thoughts, lest they disappear.

“Continue.” I said simply. She took a deep breath, controlling herself, clearly distressed. And I suppose, rightly so. While her street would still get water, it would cost them more to draw from the network rather than their own source. Miss Bartlett wasn’t rich by any means. Even though she earned more than me, which isn’t saying a whole lot, the hike in water price would hit hard. So it made sense she’d come to me.

“I wanted to add that I can’t… I can’t pay you your usual commission, Mister Hendricks. I’m just…” Her face fell. I’d always been a better read of Mons than people, but she seemed almost ashamed. I really needed money. I couldn’t afford to work for any less than commission, but she’d come to me. And, though I’m not one for honour or reputation, I’d hate myself for turning away a fellow in need.

“I’ll do it for free.”

“No, please-” She protested, but I silenced her with a raised pen.

“No charge, Miss Bartlett, but might I ask a favour?” While she didn’t look outright angry or suspicious, she did throw me an odd glance.

“What can I do?”

I shrugged. “Don’t tell anyone I’m working for free.”

She raised an eyebrow and leaned forward. “If you did, it might shatter my persona of a fearless, hard-hitting Personal Investigator.” I leaned back and ran a hand over my brow, glad I’d drawn a smile from her.

“I’ve got your address, so I’ll be by sometime this evening to have a poke around.” She breathed a sigh of relief and stood, heading for the door.

“Thank you, Mister Hendricks.”

“No problem, I’ll see you later.”

“Yep.” And with that, she disappeared, the door closing with a click. I stared at the words Hendricks: Personal Investigator, Lost and Found Mons, trying to read it backwards, already knowing its words too well, as I spoke them aloud every day when I unlocked my office.

I’d only ever heard of a Network Mon disappearing once, and it’d been stolen by a bunch of kids. It was curious that one of my past clientele would be the victim of a Squirtle-Napping, but I wasn’t really convinced it was related to our association.
