Legends exist for a reason. Whether it be for the seductiveness of mystery, to strike fear into the hardest of hearts, or for that glimpse of hope when everything seems so bleak, so unbelievably horrible – legends exist for a reason. And once upon a time, we were up there with them. The roar of a dragon once made men quiver in their boots, made women run to their children. But now, our voices are useless, echoing soundlessly against our spherical prisons. From what I’ve gathered, no one knows where we are. There is no one coming to save us. Our wings have been clipped, our breath frozen. We will never be free again. 

<br /><br />

I would have never imagined such a fate for myself, let alone for any of my kin. We had lived in peace, high atop the clouds, for thousands of years – well, most of us did, anyway. It had only seemed natural to me. Some preferred the feel of ground beneath their feet and stayed on land, and we weren’t the kind to judge. Each to their own, as Latias used to say. Of everything and everyone, I think I miss Latias the most. She was clever – still is, I suppose – but not in a way that made the rest of us uncomfortable. If anything, it made us love her more. Oh, the stories she told. She told us how the minds of the humans below us worked, how they could be confusingly intense but also exceptionally dumb at the same time. I didn’t understand at the time – I was young, foolish. But now I understand, all too well.  

<br /><br />

It’s funny how things change. It usually happens right in front of you, beauty slowly but surely morphing into some indescribable evil, crystal clear water turning into muck, legends twisting themselves into nightmares. I’ve had a while to think all of this over, and I’ll probably have a great many more to continue thinking about it. It’s so dark in here, and I only get light every second week. I think. The days kind of blend into each other, but the light’s always accompanied by a voice. Sometimes it’s harsh and grates against my scales, but other times it’s soft, soothing. Sometimes the voice reminds me of a lullaby Latias used to sing for us. Every time I catch a glimmer of light I strain as much as I can, as if the very action would lead the voice to release me. But it never happens, and I don’t think it ever will, so all she leaves me with is the colour of my skin, a now burnished orange, imprinted into the back of my eyes. I try to keep it in my mind for as long as possible. It’s the only thing I have to cling onto in the present. I can’t keep reliving memories. It’s unhealthy – or at least, that’s what Latios used to say. 

<br /><br />

I had never liked orange, you know. I preferred blue, and while I liked the sensation of having wings, I missed the shiny, slick grey-blue of my old skin. When I first evolved, I threw a tantrum that lasted for days, and they had to fetch both Latias and Latios from the other side of the clouds to calm me down. Afterwards, I slept the best sleep I’d had in years, and then Latias took me aside to teach me all about flying and using my size to my advantage. Those were better days, they truly were. We even saved a human ship during one of our lessons, and even though I couldn’t read minds, I knew our small act of kindness had meant the world to them. 

<br /><br />

Life was simpler back then. We raced each other around the world of the humans, egging one another to go faster and faster. We must have looked crazy, and it probably wasn’t the most sensible thing to do, but it was fun, and I myself took great pleasure in beating all the boys as often as I could. We dared each other to do foolish things, and dug for so-called treasure together, arms and legs flying everywhere, our claws filthy by the end. 

<br /><br />

To be honest, we didn’t pay much attention to the humans and their world. Or, at least, I didn’t. That was someone else’s responsibility. There wasn’t that much humans could do that would affect us, high up in the clouds. But how wrong I was. 

<br /><br />

I was barely an adult when the Indigo Incursion began. At the time, I didn’t know its proper name, eventually I learned the words. I was barely an adult when I volunteered to protect those of us who had chosen to live on land. Sometimes, I can’t help but wonder how differently everything would have turned out if I’d just stayed. Latias wasn’t surprised, though I could see she was upset. Her feathers ruffled and turned a dusty pink as she turned to bid me farewell.  

<br /><br />

You have a kind heart, she said, before I left. And you are strong, too. In spirit, mind and body. I know you can help. Latios gave me a Life Orb, which I kept tucked in a special pocket in my left wing. I still have it, even now. I can feel it pulsing against my skin, a reminder of Latias’ keen, smiling, amber eyes and the trust she had in me. I hope she doesn’t think I failed her. 

<br /><br />

I’d always considered humans to be civil and peaceful. I was wrong about that, too. They created fire and lightning, and directed it at each other, and sometimes even at Pokemon, too. I’d flown down to protect my kin, but now that I’d arrived, I decided I needed to protect as many of these Pokemon as I could. The other volunteers were more than capable, and I was young. I wouldn’t be missed. 

<br /><br />

So I flew away, knowing Latias and Latios could see me. I was following my heart – I was doing the right thing. I hoped. I landed in what I later learned was Goldenrod. A young woman by the name of Whitney was there, and her flaming pink hair belied her maturity. She was leading one side against the other, pink and red and all sorts of colours against a rigid line of black and slate. At first, I didn’t know why all these other people were listening to her. She was just a child, I thought. But then again, so was I. 

<br /><br />

There was so much devastation when I arrived, and it hadn’t even been a month into the fighting. I realised I couldn’t help everyone, so I had a rule. Only help those who could not help themselves – whether it be the result of a lack of speed, strength or intelligence. I moved Bellsprout and Pidgey and Sentret, just to name a few, and they were just the wild ones. I carried injured Pokemon to makeshift Pokemon Centres, and watched, too many times, as Blissey and Chansey tried to knit bone and flesh together in vain. I saw Pikachu with tails snapped clean in half, Squirtle with cracked shells, Zubat and Fearow and Wingull with bloody and split wings. 

<br /><br />

I cared for Pokémon whose trainers had died, most of them in the act of trying to protect them. Some of the less perceptive ones seemed to be confused, but those who were either more attached or more intelligent would refuse to do anything at all. Sometimes they wouldn’t even eat, and I’d have to beg and plead with them until they even tried to lift a morsel to their mouths. I helped Pokémon from both sides, not caring for alliances or anything of the sort. 

<br /><br />

I saw so much, but I feel as if I also saw very little. Humans seemed to be capable of much more than what I had witnessed with my own two eyes. They seemed so much more capable of love, destruction, death. 

<br /><br />

There was so much fighting, and while I tried to listen in on conversations, I still didn’t know why they were doing this to each other. The black and slate men were at the mercy of someone named Gary, and they spoke his name in fearful, hushed tones, acting as if he would appear if it was said too loudly. The others were with Whitney, the girl I had learned to respect during my time there. She could have stayed in her castle and hid, but she had time to come out and care for both injured Pokémon and humans. She would sit in the Pokémon Centres and console trainers who had lost their lifelong friends, and we even worked side by side a couple of times, rescuing and moving Pokémon who would otherwise have been at the mercy of others. 

<br /><br />

I only really saw her during the respite of six or seven moons. When the second swarm of black and slate men arrived, she disappeared into her castle. I watched from the outside as they hammered at it, using Pokémon by the dozen. So many of them died during the two-moon attempt. It just seemed so unfair, but there was nothing I could do but watch. 

<br /><br />

When the walls finally crumpled, I took to the air, hoping I could help in any way. But it was too much. Too much bloodlust, too much anger. The air was filled with the scent of fear and dust and sweat. There was lightning and fire everywhere, and so the castle fell as I watched from above. 

<br /><br />

I don’t know how long it took them to reach Whitney, but when they did, they tied her up and called Gary-Human. He looked small – even smaller than the rest of them, and he looked clean. He sneered at Whitney, who was kneeling on the ground, and pulled out a metal contraption that shot lightning. I hovered, confused as to why Gary would want to shoot Whitney. He had just broken into her home and killed all the other humans and Pokémon that she cared about. What good would it be to take her life too? She had done so much good for the people of the town.   

<br /><br />

I braced myself for the lightning, but for whatever reason he decided to chant a story. He laughed at her, and it was then I decided to attack. I relive that moment over and over while I am curled up in this miniature prison. Would I still be free if I had left? What would have happened if I had decided to flee back into the clouds? But in the back of my mind, I know it was the right thing to do, and I do not regret my actions. 

<br /><br />

I swooped and knocked Gary to the ground, hanging over him. The black and slate men tried to attack me almost immediately, but I barreled straight through them. Sometimes, it was almost too easy to forget how much power I held in my body. They crumpled and cracked underneath my claws, and I should have felt remorse for them, but I didn’t. I saw a blur of pink fly through the door as I finished them off, one by one, and I was relieved that at least Whitney had escaped with her life. 

<br /><br />

Time flashed by in a kaleidoscope of red, black, slate and crushed bones. And then it was just me and Gary-Human. I just wanted some answers. I wanted to know why Gary The Human was here. Why he had killed all these people, and almost killed Whitney. What purpose did it serve him? Latias and Latios had always taught us that peace was the right answer – did these humans not abide by the same rules? It seemed strange to hurt others without reason. 

<br /><br />

So I asked, and he would not answer. He just leered, saying he would tell me nothing. He would make an example on me, just like he had done many others before me. I didn’t understand, so I asked again. He still refused, flicking back his hair and snickering, telling me that my tricks wouldn’t work on him. With an age to reflect upon it, I have concluded he was stalling. 

<br /><br />

I tried to intimidate him, but he peppered my wings with rocks. He shot lightning at my knees, and so I fell, hard, undignified and ashamed. I stumbled after him, growling, mewling – making any kind of sound I could so he would answer me. I knew he could understand me, courtesy of the slick smile he had on his face. Then he ran, and I limped after him. He jeered and shouted at me, telling me I would never get anything out of him, and that he would always get what he wanted. I clawed harder at the ground, trying to accelerate, but my body refused to cooperate. He taunted me, telling me he had captured so many other of my kin, and he would do the same to me. I roared in anger now, furious that he had done such a thing, but my fury did not last long. I felt a mountain tumble onto me, rocks and boulders and all, and then everything turned grey. 

<br /><br />

I was here when I woke up, and I have been here ever since. I think I’m in a ball. A Pokeball, I think they called it. I don’t know what’s happened since then. I don’t know how long it’s been. Sometimes I hear the ground shake, and I hope to everything I hold dear that the Gary human was wrong, and all my friends are still safe. But however much I hope, I know there are elements of truth to the Gary human’s claims. 

<br /><br />

So then this is why I hope we live on in legend – not just me, but all of my kind. We are to be feared because of our capacity for destruction, but we can also show compassion, love, and care. I just hope that while I am here, some human out there remembers me, orange wings and all. I hope that they will remember that I helped and cared and nurtured, and maybe they will go on to show these characteristics to a fellow human or Pokémon. And as long as they keep performing such acts, my legend will live on – the legend of Dragonite.
