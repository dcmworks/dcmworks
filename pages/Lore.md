First Indigo Incursion
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MCM60GS.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" style="width:100%"/>
<br />
The First: The primary conflict began as an innocent Pokemon battle. Famous trainer, Ash Ketchum at aged nineteen, was challenged by a young boy to a friendly Pokemon contest. Having just reattempted to defeat Pokemon League CEO Gary Oak, Ash was reportedly emotional and angry. He took out these furstrations on the young boy, using his Charizard to dismantle and kill the child's Pokemon. The young boy surrendered after Ash's Dragon-Mon tore his Pokemon to shreds, but Ash pressed forward, ordering Charizard to slaughter the young boy. Thus began a domino of events which lead to the mistrust of Pokemon and the League itself. Rebellion in Goldenrod City begun, resulting in the destruction of Lavender Town. The fighting climaxed with Lt. Surge's assault of the Indigo Plateau. Lt. Surge and his followers publically executed Loerlei and Bruno, Lance and Gary Oak eventually locking up the separatists, the Organisation of Prenatural Legislation formed to police and regulate Pokemon in future. The First Incursion left many feeling uneasy, as if their rights to own Pokemon were being challenged, the political tides ebbing and flowing as the world prepared for more conflict.

Second Indigo Incursion

The Second: Eight years of unrest follow after the First Indigo Incursion, and the Pokemon League's new body, the Organisation of Prenatural Legislation, has finally begun the registration and cataloguing of Pokemon. The Second Incursion was sparked by this process of gathering trainers and owners to Pokemon League centres and check points to register Pokemon on a central database. Of all places, it was Twin Leaf town, an unassuming village in Sinnoh, where problems began. A fifteen year old girl refused to allow the League to confiscate her dangerous Blaziken, using the Pokemon to tear the mobile cataloguing centre to pieces. News spread that the League were confiscating dangerous Pokemon like wildfire. Brock Takeshi, Ash's ex-travel companion, is head of the Department of Necessities, under the Organisation of Prenatural Legislation. Brock's divison is effectively the enforcing arm of the OPL, responsible for any police work required to confiscate or deal with Pokemon related crimes. While Brock was distracted by the child's actions, in Veilstone City, a bank was violently robbed with Pokemon. This resulted in a citywide lockdown to catch the thieves. The lockdown lasted for a month before the people of Veilstone peacefully protested which resulted in the protestors being gunned down. The world erupted in protest of the League's handling of Veilstone, and debate occurs as to whether or not the League were responsible for the killing of the protestors. Evidence comes to light that Gary planned to capture and lockdown Veilstone, the head of the Pokemon League going off the rails, dying in the middle of Goldenrod on national telivison by his own hand. Brock Takeshi takes a more active role in the cleanup, settling the public by suggesting Gary acted outside of the League's authority, the OPL falling closer into line as a Legislative body, rather than the brute force Gary had composed it to be.

Third Indigo Incursion

The Third: Less than coincidentally, the Third Incursion occured eight years after Gary's death. Brock Takeshi, head of the Department of Necessities, and Melinda Oak, Gary Oak's widow, are doing a good job of ensuring the League is tamed and dealing with Pokemon control appropriately. A terrorist threat is made out of nowhere. Unknown powers claim they intend to destroy Goldenrod City but offer no demands. The next day, supporters of Lt. Surge's cause appeared in New Bark Town, destroying the city and killing the citizens. Surge's supporters claimed Cherrygrove City within the week, fortifying the line between the two areas in a formidable front. They named this new front of supporters RedWall, and forced the League to entrench themselves, and within a few months, the League and RedWall entered into solid, slow, trench warfare. RedWall began to overwhelm the League, who fell back to Goldenrod and evacuated civillains. The League turned the city into one big sprawling fortress. What followed was a two year war of attrition, the League slowly being pushed back through the city. Rumours swirl about the depraved acts which occur, the state of the city and the terrorist threats. Before the League had lost its foothold completely, Goldenrod was glassed in an insant. Bombs burned the city to the ground with nothing left but rubble and corpses. The conflict ended with the loss of Goldenrod, the two towns of RedWall still controlled by Surge's supporters, but quarantined by Melinda Oak. She bled them dry of supplies over the ten years that followed.

Fourth Indigo Incursion
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/BUM6Ysb.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" style="width:100%"/>
The Fourth: Ten years after the Third, Melinda Oak finally assembled a task force to infiltrate RedWall and put them down. Led by the famous Lance, the squad was met with an army of resistance. The League had assumed RedWall was decaying, but rather, they had spent ten years building arms, supplies and men. Lt. Surge, Whitney and Sabrina led RedWall's forces, dismantling Lance's small force instantly. The League applied all of their resources in their effort to take down RedWall, but this resulted in warfare similar to the Third Incursion. In an effort to avoid another war of attrition, Melinda Oak sent in a black ops squad to kill Surge and Whitney silently. The mission turned south when Sabrina confronted them. What occured afterwards is not known, only that RedWall was destroyed in a single evening. A single firestorm destroyed New Bark Town, Cherrgrove City and the whole of RedWall for good.
