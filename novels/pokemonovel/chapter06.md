<br />
I was roused from heavy sleep by a repeating thud-thud. I stumbled to the door while throwing a shirt on and collecting my revolver from where it hung, just left of the door. I transferred it to my right hand and opened the door slightly, keeping my weapon concealed. After my eyes adjusted, I realised I was face to face with the postman. 
“Delivery for Mr Hendricks.”
<br />
“One sec,” I offered, briefly closing the door to slip the gun in its holster. I signed the digital pad and he handed me a package, which was about the size of a shoe box.

<br /><br />

It was wrapped in vintage brown paper, all fancy, with string holding it all together. I sat at the tiny table which passed for my dining room and dug into it. It was a shoe box. Just a shoe box. But as I opened it up, I saw that it was, packed densely with fluffy stuff to stop the item inside from being damaged in transit. And yeah, I realise I just explained the purpose of packaging something. 

<br /><br />
Sitting on a swirl of cushiony cloth, shining, was an uncompressed Great Ball. It was polished and buffed beautifully, and as I turned it over in my hands, I noted the official seal of the Pokémon League carved into its base. This was worth a hundred bucks at least; maybe more considering the serial number dated its production as two months ago. I’d never owned a ball this expensive before. Which made me suspicious, considering I hadn’t ordered one, nor did anyone like me enough to send me a gift, let alone a gift worth this much.

<br /><br />

<br /><br />

I rifled through the packaging and eventually found a note, scribbled hastily on the back of a faded receipt. 
<br />
“To M. Hendricks, you seemed like you needed some more firepower,” I read aloud, surprised to see it was signed simply by the letter F. F for what? Furian? That didn’t make sense, and this was an official Poke Ball, so it seemed safe to rule out the man who’d run the warehouse I’d visited last night. There wasn’t anyone else I knew who’d fit. That was bad. Gifts from strangers were always trouble. A few years ago, I’d been given an apple by some random guy when I was at a market, and by chance I happened to cut it open before I ate it, and the damn thing was filled with nails. Who does that?

<br /><br />

So naturally, knowing it would be dangerous to open the Ball, I tapped the button to release the Pokémon within. The red energy darted and bounced off the wall, solidifying into a dark blue figure, crouched close to the ground. It took me a moment to work it out, but it was definitely a Greninja. Very carefully, I slowed all my movements to a stop. I didn’t move, didn’t breathe, and even willed myself to stop blinking. I wasn’t sure if this was another attempt on my life, or a present. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, really, but this was too good to be true. A U-Ranked Pokémon in a hundred dollar Ball from the enigmatic F meant that I wasn’t convinced the ninja Pokémon an arm’s length from my feet was safe. It might well murder me horribly.

<br /><br />


Greninja, as I understand it, are used by the black ops units of the OPL to assassinate high priority and well-funded targets. My eyes traced over the creature, and I tried to focus on my breathing, which was getting louder. The dark blue and black frog-Mon slowly eased itself to its full height, its frog legs straightening. It was around a head higher than me, a black scarf hanging from its neck. The ninja-frog turned, one arm – or leg? I’m not sure, I guess when it’s standing I’d call it an arm – raised before its face, as if imploring me to hush. The damn thing stared right at me, red eyes locked on mine, unmoving, emotionless. There was an illegal Pokémon in my apartment, possibly sent to kill me, standing less than a pace from my face, staring me down. 
<br /><br />

After a beat, the Greninja croaked huskily, lowering its hand from its face. It extended the webbed, three fingered limb toward me. Damn thing wanted me to shake hands and then kill me. Against my best instincts, I shook the webby mitt. I released its grip and the creature continued to appraise me, rather than rip me to shreds. Good start, I supposed. If this illegal Greninja wasn’t here to tear my throat out, then it was certainly not to be kept. I knew I needed to take it to Takeshi, to turn it in to the OPL for a proper investigation. Of course, I could keep it. 

<br /><br />

Trying to name a six foot ninja-frog Mon is difficult, and if I was going to keep it, I didn’t want a stupid name. All of my Pokémon had names for a reason – except Bree, I was just lazy when I received her – that or at the very least not something too long. I was getting tired of Greek tragedy as well. So perhaps more complex, though with the day I’d had, complex was beyond me. A problem for later.

<br /><br />

I made breakfast and considered how perfect Greninja were for assassinations. They specialised in stealth, and were able to produce water shuriken – solid when thrown, but after five minutes, dissolved into nothing but a pool of water. They could kill someone silently and leave no murder weapon. They were brilliant killing machines, and had been outlawed during the first wave of U-Rank Classifications, way back during the first Indigo Incursion when they culled the first wave of Pokémon. Those were darker times, and I didn’t want to think about how many Pokémon and innocent people Greninja had slain. I flipped my eggs for the last time, buttered my toast and wolfed it all down, followed by a slow coffee. 

<br /><br />

I sipped the last of my coffee while reading the paper. There are few better ways to start a day than with a big breakfast, good coffee and the previous day’s affairs. Having finished the back end of the news, I tossed the paper aside and slipped on a pair of grey jeans and a blue dress shirt. After a moment of derision, I tugged on my old cowboy boots, certain that it’d help me fulfil a few more clichés. At least I’d look good while they did so. I left the house at around nine, heading for work.

<br /><br />

My office is about a fifteen minute drive from my flat, on the fifth floor of a regular office building. The first few floors were used by an accounting firm, and the few floors above me were filled with dentists, of all professions. My level consisted entirely of freelance offices. There was myself, a handful of contract lawyers, even a few random architects, psychiatrists and I’m pretty sure, though I’ve never had the nerve to check, some guy who sells time share houses in Tahiti. My office itself is at the opposite end of the main hallway to Tahiti-Guy, so whenever I hear footsteps from my desk, chances are it’s someone coming to see me. Most of my work days are spent reading and listening – when I’m not working with Takeshi – so when I got to work, I made myself another coffee and kicked my feet up. I entertained myself by doing a little research on the OPL database, paging through the hit-list, as is my morning ritual.  

<br /><br />

The database is sort of their version of a police database, except it’s a compilation of recently sited or captured illegal Pokémon. I was searching for any leads on Devin Western’s murder – maybe a Scizzor or a Scyther, or anything with a decent breath attack – but after an hour I realised I was looking for a Greninja. The ball felt heavy on my belt, and its feeling on my palm was almost constant, like I was afraid it’d fly away if I didn’t keep touching it. Talk about paranoid.

<br /><br />

The concentration required to rock back on my chair, use the computer, and turn the Great Ball over in my hand was more than excessive, so when the phone on my desk came alive about twenty-past ten, I yelped and the chair disappeared from beneath me, the ball spinning as I crashed to the floor. With a self-deprecating mumble, I found my feet and answered the phone, rubbing my shoulder begrudgingly. 
<br />
“Hendricks PI, lost and found, what can I help you with?”
<br />
“It’s me.” Takeshi’s voice was rich and chirpy, more like the man I knew well. He actually sounded refreshed.
<br />
“Got any leads?”
<br />
“Maybe. We still do not know why Vermillion – the woman from last night’s escapade, you shall recall, wanted to bring you to the warehouse. When we seized the site, all of the Balls were recovered, such that all which remained were the remnants of the operation. It is entirely possible she wanted to kill you for Furian, her employer, but I still cannot outline a motive. You Are not exactly an enemy to Poke Ball smugglers,” he mused, almost talking to himself, so I leaned back and listened. Eventually he finished talking and told me what I was waiting for.
<br />
“Oh, but we did find something at the warehouse. No one knows what to do with it; it’s sort of your department. We can’t identify it. Come by the station when you’re ready and you can pick it up, with your cheque for last month.” Pay day. Score.

<br /><br />

I parked in the visitor’s spot, directly below the sign. It was all glossy and perfect, and had probably cost them a crap-load, reading Organisation of Prenatural Legislation, with a small OPL beneath it. I headed inside, clipping the little laminated badge to my cloak, stepping inside the skyscraper which housed the OPL. The building was only a few years old, so it had all the new bells and whistles, top grade security systems, solar panels, air conditioning which knew how many people were in the room, and plenty of Feng Shui. 

<br /><br />
I stepped through the automatic doors, past four security guards – and into the lobby, hit with a gentle twenty-four degrees, intelligent air conditioning. It wasn’t hot or cold, it was just exactly the right temperature. I started to walk forward and paused. They’d changed the layout of the lobby again.

<br /><br />

To my left was a series of benches behind a grate, where the public could go to make complaints, report problems and even request Pokémon. A few civilians waited in line, and a few sat in comfy looking chairs I wished I owned. I moved past the chairs and toward the far end of the room. To the right were bathrooms and a little coffee stand with some tables, but directly in front of me was the security checkpoint I recognised. Two security guards, and a metal detector. Ironically, last time I was here I was arrested, of all things, for having too many Poke Balls. Turns out that the Fourth Incursion passed a motion for no more than eight, and I’d had twelve empty Balls in my pack which I was bringing to Takeshi. So they’d tackled me, locked me up, and I’d spent a very embarrassing night in prison because Takeshi wasn’t answering his phone that day. Apparently he was in a meeting. 

<br /><br />

I sucked in a deep breath and headed toward the checkpoint, glancing at my badge to make sure it was clearly displayed. There was a little portrait of me, a description of my job and the word contractor in bold letters.
<br /><br />
I approached the guard and he glanced at my badge, nodding.
<br />
“Gun and Balls?” I handed the three balls I had on me – Bree, Creon and Greninja – with my revolver. He put them in a little Perspex box and put a lid on it, padlocking the thing closed and putting it on a shelf behind him. I headed through to the lifts and up to Takeshi’s office. 

<br /><br />

The Department of Necessities – the subset of the OPL Takeshi runs – occupies a full floor, mostly a series of cubicles, and at one end Takeshi and some other guy have an office. I’ve never been in the adjacent room, but I hear yelling occasionally, so I tend to avoid it and hide in Takeshi’s office. 
<br /><br />
I knocked on Takeshi’s door, and read the embossed letters while I waited. Brock Takeshi, Department of Necessities: Chief. He had a nicer door than I did, and fancier lettering.

<br /><br />

The door swung open to reveal an alive Takeshi, wearing a sharp suit and a smile.
<br />
“Morning, Mister Hendricks.”
<br />
“Barely. What have you got for me?” Whether it was the lack of sleep or the too-clean and almost sterile building, for whatever reason I wasn’t feeling quite as chipper. Takeshi ignored my bluntness and closed the door behind us.

<br /><br />

It was sitting on a metal tray on his desk. Roughly the length of my index finger, the object was red at the tip and white, as if from an oddly coloured vase. It curved away from the table like it was from a Ball. 
<br />
“Ideas?” He inquired, gesturing for me to examine the thing. I picked it up gingerly and ran my hands over it. Too smooth for a Poke Ball. Crap. 
<br />
“Well?” I barely heard him. This would make the Ball the right diameter too. That was impossible, no one used them anymore, and they were too volatile, unpredictable even to the best trainers. I placed the shard back on its tray and tried to swallow the lump in my throat.
<br />
“It’s from an Electrode.” I choked out, staring at Takeshi. He flexed his knuckles, and his smile disappeared, replaced by visible irritation and confusion.
<br />
“Oh.”

<br /><br />

“Yeah.” I responded, shaking my head. “Where exactly did your team recover it?”
<br />
“From the warehouse floor, near one of the belts where the Balls were put together, why?” 
<br />
“We might have a lead. Get a few officers down to the warehouse, we’ll meet them there.”
<br />
“Why can’t we just take a squad car?”
<br />
“We’ve got a stop to make first.” 
<br />
He blanched. “Must we? I find him… intolerable.”
<br />
“We must. Let’s go.” I headed from Takeshi’s office and he trailed, grumbling to himself.

<br /><br />
We got in the Golf and headed to meet an old friend of mine. I considered calling ahead, but he’d probably not care for company anyway. After ten minutes I parked up on the street and Takeshi followed me across the road, stepping into the comfy lobby of a skyscraper covered in solar panels; Volk-A Energy.

<br /><br />

I don’t know how to best describe Denzi Volkner. We went to school together, and I fought by his side during the Third Incursion when we were both barely eighteen, but he never grew up. I got grouchy and sarcastic, and Volkner remained a cool, collected, relaxed, apathetic jerk. I quite liked him. Takeshi didn’t.

<br /><br />
“Hiya, how may I help you Mister Hendricks? Here to see me or Mister Volkner?” I nodded and made small talk with the cute blonde receptionist. She’d been working here since Denzi established his business headquarters, and she’d been flirting with me ever since I got drunk with her a few Christmas parties back. We… um… it’s not important, but I know her quite well. So while I flirted shamelessly, Takeshi flipped through the Business Portfolio and had a coffee. 

<br /><br />


Just as Takeshi finished his four dollar flat white, the smiley receptionist led us through the lifts to the top floor, announcing us while we entered.

<br /><br />
Denzi Volkner’s office was on floor fifty-three, the very top of his multi-million dollar tower skyscraper made of solar damn panels, and the walls were made entirely of glass. My breath caught in my chest, as it always does, and I swear Takeshi gasped. 

<br /><br />

The midday sun was directly overhead, so I could turn three-sixty and see the whole city. It’d been a while since I’d come up here, and the city had changed some. There were more skyscrapers than ever, the inner-city becoming progressively taller. We were right in the middle of it all, dwarfed by some of the newer office constructions, but still looking down at the rooftops of the city. It was a beautiful place to be. 

<br /><br />
After I finished soaking it in, I turned my attention to the room itself. If you ignored the glass walls, it was pretty normal for a CEO’s office; lavish furniture, posh carpet, an old oak desk and a figure reclining in a desk chair behind it. His yellow hair was slicked back, his eyes glazed over, and he seemed to be examining the ceiling with keen interest. I followed his gaze and saw a Monitor directly above him, and then I noticed a mouse in his hand. He was working while reclining. How cosy.

<br /><br />
“Gentlemen.” Volkner drawled.
<br />
“Mister Volkner.” Takeshi mumbled, sitting in one of the chairs before Denzi’s desk. I followed suit, plopping into the armchair that would’ve been more suited to my living room than an office. Denzi had a certain style to him, and the chairs fit perfectly in the fancy yet casual hipster thing he had going on.
<br />
“Hey, Denzi.” When I spoke, he sat upright, apparently properly noticing us for the first time. He went from relaxed and lazy to formal, offering us each a firm handshake. 
<br /><br />
“Are we here for work or fun, fellas?” Denzi asked easily, tapping a touch screen on his desk a few times. A petite – I swear she looked French? – young woman entered from the lift with two glasses of water and a cola. She placed the cola on the desk next to Volkner and offered us water, which we both accepted gladly. His assistant disappeared and I took a sip. 
<br />
“This is the best water I’ve ever had.” I mused.
<br />
“Tastes like lemon and jasmine.” Takeshi agreed begrudgingly. After a few sips, I realised we’d have to get to business.

<br /><br />

“We need your help with a case, Denzi.” The kid leaned back in his chair, swirling the ice cubs in his cola with a smirk on his face.
“The Department can offer you…” Takeshi began to explain, but Denzi raised a hand.
<br />
“I’ll waive it ‘cause we’re old friends.” I hid my smile, as Takeshi seemed almost visibly pained that Denzi insisted on working for free. Takeshi was old fashioned; he liked to pay contractors and outside help, which was great for me, and entertaining when Denzi entered the picture.
<br /><br />
“So what do you need?” Denzi asked lazily, relaxed like ever. I dug into my pocket and produced the Electrode shard, handing it to him carefully. He turned it over, eyed it carefully, and then licked it. Takeshi scowled the whole time. “What exactly do you wanna know?”
<br />
“Place of origin, type of ball used, age, time of detonation, and anything else you can tell us.” Volkner didn’t respond, just continued examining the shard. Takeshi and I both had our notepads ready like students, prepared for the story of the Electrode. 

<br /><br />
“I suppose we’ll start with the easy stuff. This was a mature Electrode, maybe five years old. That means someone kept it for a specific reason, waiting to use it. So when it detonated, it was definitely premeditated. I’d say this was trained in the city, just based on the density of its outer shell.” He compared the thickness of the piece to his finger. It was very thin. 
<br />
“It matches a few I’ve seen who were raised in confines, so probably a Tank-Mon.” Tank-Mon is an expression we use for Pokémon grown in a lab or in a breeding farm, rather than free range or wild. 
<br />
“Based on the maturation of the Red Resin, I’d guess it was kept in a cheap Poke Ball and detonated sometime last week.” He paused and licked it. 
“I can’t tell where it was detonated because there’s no other residue on this piece, but I’m fairly sure it would’ve been noticed. Would’ve put out a ten-meter radius I’d guess, hot explosion, incineration of any organic matter within two meters. This was a powerful weapon,” Volkner explained, taking his time so we could jot everything down.

<br /><br /> 
“That’s about all I’ve got.” I made a few additional details on my notepad.
<br />
I thanked Denzi and we made some small talk before Takeshi announced we had to leave. We shook Volkner’s hand, and then he sat down, becoming the smarmy kid I remembered. It’s funny how people change when they’re immersed in something they’re passionate about. 

<br /><br />

We stepped out of Volka-A Energy and headed back to the department, and I felt uneasy. Takeshi made a phone call, asking for a list of ten-meter explosions in the last two weeks. He turned to me, face stern, phone returned to his jacket.
<br />
“What if…” he begun.
<br />
“They have more?” I finished, knowing he was turning over the possibility of someone stockpiling Electrodes. Takeshi nodded. 
<br />
I wasn’t sure, but if whoever was running this gig – whether it be Furian or some shadowed figure – had more Electrodes, things could get bad quickly. 
<br />
“Then it’s terrorism like we haven’t seen since the Fourth Incursion.” I finally responded, scared almost to think it out loud.
<br />
“You’ve fought Electrodes before?” He prodded after a pause.
<br />
“I was there at the fall of Goldenrod.”
<br />
“I know. I read your file before I hired you, remember? Did you fight them?” I’d forgotten that Takeshi knew everything about me, not just the rumours. He’d read the truth, printed on A4 in black ink.

<br /><br />


I could see it in my head, foggy but vivid as hell. Flashes of the huge city, aflame in the evening sun, Salamance dive-bombing the city, laying waste to humans and Mons alike, cooking them with equal menace. I couldn’t hear the screams. We ran. We fought and we lost and we ran. 

<br /><br />

“I didn’t fight the Electrodes, but I watched them level Goldenrod.”
<br />
“What are we talking?”
<br />
“They erupted in a chain, glassed the city in seconds.”
<br />
“We have to act.”
<br />
“Yeah, Furian or whoever it is that’s playing us, has something big on the way.” Takeshi’s phone buzzed and we had two addresses to check. I turned the car around and we headed out, sobered and quiet. We were in the middle of a big play, and it was only going downhill from here.
