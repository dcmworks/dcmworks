<br />
We stood in front of a Chinese restaurant which claimed to produce miracle Ramen. I found their verbose sign hard to believe, and mentioned as much to Takeshi, who just grunted. Poor fellow didn’t have a sense of humour. 
<br /><br />
Takeshi stepped into the restaurant and I followed. It had a kind of cute atmosphere, lanterns hanging here and there, the smell of duck and noodles filling the air. Takeshi walked in with his badge held up, the metal Poke Ball with OPL in the centre reflecting in the fluorescent lights. We were approached by a young Asian man who was all muscle. He had a shaved head, a series of tattoos wound along his arms and below his singlet. He seemed to me a very angry boy.
<br /><br />

“What you want?” He asked in a thick Japanese accent, his vocal chords tightening.
<br />
“Hello sir, I’m with the OPL, may I speak to whoever owns this restaurant?”
<br />
“What you want with boss?”
<br />
“I need to ask him some questions in relation to a recent crime.” 
<br />
“Follow,” he said simply.

<br /><br />
Strange that a Japanese fellow would be working at a Chinese restaurant, also odd they would serve ramen at a Chinese restaurant… but I let it go. There were more pressing matters. 

<br /><br />

He led us across the dining room floor, through the kitchen and down a hall to an office. I say office in the vaguest sense. It was a storage room, boxes lining the walls, bottles of soda here and there, bags of prawn crackers stacked in a corner. Directly in the middle of the room was a desk and a middle-aged Asian woman was perched behind it. 
<br /><br />
While Takeshi had dark skin and oriental features, I was stuck being pasty and white, to the point where I’d never had a tan in my life. Suffice to say the four young, muscle-bound Asian lads standing behind me with guns hidden beneath their clothes scared the crap out of me. Not in a racist way, just in the they-have-guns-and-they’re-part-of-the-same-chinese-restaurant-gang kind of way.

<br /><br />

“Ma’am, my name is Director Takeshi, I’m with the OPL. This is my associate, PI Hendricks. We have a few questions for you about a sensitive issue, best discussed in private.” He turned his head in the direction of the four men behind us. “So perhaps if you dismiss your friends, we can chat.” 

<br /><br />

Takeshi, to his credit, is a great detective and leader. However, he’s not always the most sensitive and aware individual, reflected in the guns that were trained even closely on our two bodies. Then again, there’s a reason Takeshi hires me. I launched into action, speaking clearly, concisely, and with both hands raised.
<br /><br />
“Okay then, gentlemen. You seem to have your guns pointed at us. Excellent. Might I suggest a compromise of sorts? You see, you’ve forgotten two crucial things. We’re both lawmen, so you won’t shoot us. Second, I’ve got something worse than a gun.” Takeshi took the cue, vaulting across the desk into the Asian woman, slamming her to the ground. Just before he jumped, I loosed Bree in a smooth motion, the red lightning splashing into her shape. I covered my eyes while she formed, a brilliant explosion of light cutting the room in half from the rings along her body. 
<br /><br />
I flipped Bree’s empty ball into my other palm and reached for my belt, releasing… oh… Greninja. The frog ninja formed between me and the four reeling fellows, so I dived forward and hoped it would know what to do, and not murder them horribly. I’d wanted to throw Creon, but I must’ve put the balls on my belt in the wrong order after I left the OPL.

<br /><br />

I hit the ground and tucked, slamming against the desk, slipping the two balls back on by belt, all the while hoping to live for another few moments. 
<br /><br />
Greninja launched, tossing the two men on the left to the ground, a frog-foot crushing the singlet-clad Asian lad’s throat. While he clawed for oxygen, a blade of water materialised from Greninja’s palm, slashing the remaining man to the floor. Droplets hit my face while the lad fought to keep his intestines, losing the battle. 

<br /><br />

I managed to my feet, returning both my Mons. Takeshi stood with Asian boss-lady, her arms behind her back, cuffed nicely. Actually, Takeshi had a black eye and a few bruises.
<br />
“Good work Hendricks,” he muttered, scowling through a bloodied nose and bruised face.
<br />
“I only killed one of them.”
<br />
“One out of four, that’s impressive restraint for you.” I grinned at the joke, and scrambled to the dying man. 
<br /><br />

I’d saved many lives during the war, so my hands moved fast and sure, shoving the man’s intestines in roughly the right spot. Takeshi appeared beside me while I soaked up some of the blood to get a better look at the wounds.
<br />
“What do you need?” He asked.
<br />
“I need a needle and thread. Or something to hold his chest closed.” Takeshi nodded and disappeared.

<br /><br />
I ended up using fishing wire and a fairly unsanitary needle, but I got him sewn up and knocked out. Takeshi cuffed the other Asian fellas and called for backup, so we set about finally asking our questions.

<br /><br />

“Name and occupation?” Takeshi asked, both of us ready to write. He was in charge of recording her answers and I was on behavioural details – searching for lies, nerves and so forth.
<br />
“Yuri Yeh. I own this restaurant for a living.” She said in perfect, crisp English, a contrast to her hand-cuffed singlet-wearing lackey. 
<br />
“Thank you Miss Yeh, where were you yesterday at midday?” Yuri paused. Which, contrary to every police show ever, usually means the next words are going to be the truth. Not all of us have instant recall of our lives, and anyone who does has probably rehearsed. Remember that.

<br /><br />
“I was here. I think I was receiving the delivery around twelve, though I am not certain. You could check the delivery logs, or contact the supplier. I am still not clear if I was there at precisely midday.” Now that was odd. A little too detailed and reflexive for a regular recall. I scribbled a few things down about her body language and the way she cocked her head when admitted her reluctance to commit to her story. Takeshi left me with Yuri while he checked the delivery logs, and returned with time stamped signatures which showed Yuri had accepted the week’s supplies for the restaurant at eleven past twelve. So she wasn’t at the crime scene.

<br /><br />

Takeshi demanded a variety of details, and by the time backup arrived, we were able to cross-off this regular Chinese restaurant from involvement in our case. However, it did leave a single question; why did she have young thugs stupid enough to pull on lawmen?
<br />
“Why did your boys pull guns on us?” I said, irritated already. Damn punks. I’d nearly killed one for god’s sake. I’ve always tried to avoid equal reactions to violence, but I was scared, and people do stupid things when they’re afraid. 
<br />
“They were nervous.” She murmured, hesitant for the first time since we’d sat down with her.
<br />
“Oh? Good. Next time a police man comes to my door, when he makes me short of breath, I’ll pull a pistol on him,” I snarked, raising a finger and gesturing shooting my imaginary officer. She shook her head in confusion.
<br />
“They are not smart boys, and they have bad English. I am sorry and arresting them will teach a lesson.”

<br /><br />

We strolled to the car, leaving the restaurant in police hands.
<br />
“I don’t buy it.” I said while I buckled my seatbelt. 
<br />
“Nor do I, but we have more pressing problems. This is a police matter now, they shall address it. We still have my men waiting at the warehouse, will they be necessary?”
<br />
“Yep, we have to go check a few things out, then I need to take care of something.”
<br />
“Excellent.” Takeshi made the phone call to the men at the warehouse, who were eating a late lunch, and then I drove us over, irritated by the detour the Chinese restaurant had caused. We still had another address on our list matching the Electrode explosion, so it was to the warehouse, then the second address, and then I had to go check something of my own. I had a feeling I’d missed something at Miss Bartlett’s house last night. <br />
