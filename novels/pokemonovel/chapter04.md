I pulled into the driveway of Miss Bartlett’s cosy suburban home, only about a twenty minute drive from the gas station. I flicked the lights off and left her in gear, switching off the engine. My old car turned off with a splutter.

<br /><br />

Miss Bartlett lived in a one-story building with her three cats. Her SUV was parked outside. It was a reasonably high-end model from the previous year. She was a nice sort and reasonably well off, which in my mind raised questions regarding the police’s disinterest in this case. I also wondered why someone would bother stealing a network Squirtle.

<br /><br />

I rapped on the door in two even thumps. Miss Bartlett answered the door, dressed the same as this morning besides the jacket. Her hair was down now, wispy about her tired features. I tried not to notice that the first few buttons of her blouse were undone but failed, stealing a brief glance. Damn, she was pretty.
<br />
“Mister Hendricks.”
<br />
“Ah, Miss Bartlett, sorry I’m so late. Ran into some trouble.” She nodded and gestured me in. I stepped inside, suddenly close enough to smell her. 
<br />
“Mister Hendricks.” She whispered, stepping toward me. I inhaled a sweet mix of jasmine and sandalwood. Her hair brushed against my chest as she stepped close enough to hug me. Or ki-

<br /><br />

Miss Bartlett, it turned out, was the best kisser I’ve ever met. Which, in fairness, is against a sample size of four. At some point she guided me to the sofa. She had soft hands and her blouse was well-tailored, showing plenty of skin and directed my eyes down. Her skirt was shorter than I remembered. She ran a hand over the collar of my new cloak and leaned past me, mouth brushing against my ear.

<br /><br />

“I like your new look. It’s booty time, Mr Pirate.” Jesus, that was cheesy. But hot.

<br /><br />

Her blouse dropped to the floor and I stared at the swell of her chest, trying to focus. Words and thoughts raced through the back of my head while the rest of my body touched her soft skin and kissed her supple lips. This wasn’t some cheap Ditto copy, it couldn’t be – the way she purred and pressed herself against me told me that this was definitely Miss Bartlett. But there was something wrong. There wasn’t a network Pokémon absent from the registry. Why didn’t that bother me when she’d said it? Was it because she was pretty?

<br /><br />

I leaned forward and bit her neck gently. She sighed, body arching as she slipped over her lacy bra, full breasts before me. Goddamn, I hate being right. I pressed myself against her, and breathed into her ear.
<br />
“Keep going. Don’t show any sign you know that I know. Where are they? What do they have on you?” She went rigid for a beat and then continued sliding against me, and even though I was now scared for my life, I somehow managed to enjoy it. Fancy that.

<br /><br />

She straddled me, her skirt draping around my jeans, hair hanging over her breasts perfectly. Good lord, she was beautiful. I wasn’t sure how I’d missed that before. Don’t judge me, it’d been a really long time since I’ve been with anyone. And she really was beautiful. 

<br /><br />

She leaned forward, my hands cupping her ass as she whispered in my ear again. 
<br />
“Woman named Vermillion, has my Eevee and Charmeleon. Wants me to keep you busy tonight.” Then she bit my ear and I almost lost it.
<br />
“Bedroom.” I muttered, kissing her again, trying not to enjoy myself too much. She led me to the bedroom, shedding her skirt along the way, leaving me to stare at her curvy bottom in her purple panties while she took me into the next room. She shoved me into the door, pinning me there with her body.
<br />
“They watching?” I asked into her mouth. She shook her head and I shoved her away gently. “Wait, what? Then why are we…?”
<br />
“Because I want to.” 

<br /><br />

You might judge me, or even Miss Bartlett. Her Pokemons’ lives were on the line, and she’d been coerced initially, but there had been a strange fleck to her passion earlier.I’d thought it odd. Usually when one is hired to seduce, they go straight for the sex. Bartlett had been tender and thoughtful, and passionate. She’d wanted to be close to me. And I wanted her. So we made love, and as crass as it might seem, we did have a while to kill so that her employer wouldn’t grow suspicious. Oh. Bad choice of words.

<br /><br />


We rushed into my Golf, fully clothed once more. As I closed the door, I gave her a quick glance, raising an eyebrow. She seemed thoughtful.
<br />
“I was just thinking.” she explained, running a hand through her dark hair. “I was just thinking that you’re single.” I nodded. “Do you want to go out sometime?” I grinned.
<br />
“Well, Miss Bartlett,” I began, easing the Golf into reverse, “I think I rather would. But first, let’s take care of business.” And with that, we clunked down the street in my beat up Golf, heading for the address she’d been instructed to keep me from. 

<br /><br />

You know, it’s funny. I keep wishing I’d let her distract me more, but you can’t change the past I guess. We arrived at the address around midnight, and as I moved to open the door, Miss Bartlett placed a hand on my shoulder.
<br />
“I’m Audrey.” She smiled a beautiful smile.
<br />
“Hi Audrey, name’s Hendricks, lovely to meet you. Let’s get your friends back.” I focused and stepped from the car, Poke Ball in one hand, gun in the other, cloak swirling in my wake.
