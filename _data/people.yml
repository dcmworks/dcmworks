As well as writing the novels you see on Dcmworks I also run a Youtube channel, attend University and write fantasy on the side.

She also moonlights as DCMWorks’ lore extraordinaire between hair flips, too-full glasses of red wine and pushing her spectacles up her nose. Yen-Rong is hoping that this will make her famous enough to be able to criticise Tony Abbott without any occupational consequences.
