The First: The primary conflict began as an innocent Pokemon battle. Famous trainer Ash Ketchum, aged nineteen, was challenged by a young boy to a friendly contest. Having just reattempted to defeat Pokemon League CEO Gary Oak, Ash was reportedly emotional and angry. He took out these furstrations on the young boy, using his Charizard to dismantle and kill the child's Pokemon. The young boy surrendered after Ash's Dragon-Mon tore his Pokemon to shreds, but Ash pressed forward, ordering Charizard to slaughter the young boy. Thus began a domino of events which lead to the mistrust of Pokemon and the League itself. Rebellion in Goldenrod City begun, resulting in the destruction of Lavender Town. The fighting climaxed with Lt. Surge's assault of the Indigo Plateau. Lt. Surge and his followers publically executed Loerlei and Bruno, Lance and Gary Oak eventually locking up the separatists, the Organisation of Prenatural Legislation formed to police and regulate Pokemon in future. The First Incursion left many feeling uneasy, as if their rights to own Pokemon were being challenged, the political tides ebbing and flowing as the world prepared for more conflict.
