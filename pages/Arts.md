A lot of the art we make takes time and various tools. We usually begin by having an artists do a rough outline, and then they apply their magical talent to produce an inked image. From there, if it's a standalone image, it gets coloured digitally or manually. Most of the banners are coloured and drawn by the wonderufl Lindsey, who often uses a mix of water colours and shading. When we have a larger piece of by another artist, it often calls for digital colouring. Below is an insight into how we manipulate the images and art we have to create some of the cool effects you see on the site.

This is the first scan of the image. Our artist Talon took a few hours to sketch and then ink what you see here. You'll note there's artefacts here and there, just a result of trying to nail it.

Next, Talon colours the image with flat colours, not worrying too much about cleaning up the mistakes, focusing more on tone and contrast.

The image is then given to David, who scrubs off the artefacts, rough edges, and even to add finer details if needed. In this image, you can see the contrast is a little higher than it was before, and the background is entirely transparent, all of the artefacts removed.

What happens next tends to vary. Depending on what we're using the image for, any of about six things occur. In this case, it's for the homepage banner, so David wants to make it convey the tone of the novel. Using some nifty photoshop magic, he adds in a light source on the tip of the cigarette with a slight orange tinge, as if the cigarette is the only light source. He then scrubs the edges of the image so they're smooth and spends several hours producing and hating backgrounds. Eventually he settles on something.

Here we see the final product. With branding and font correct, the image is good to go.
