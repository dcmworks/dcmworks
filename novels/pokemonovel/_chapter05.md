I blew the lock off and kicked the door open, revolver cocked. My Quilava darted around me and through the door. Creon – I’d named him after a King from an Ancient Greek tragedy, but that’s a story for another day – gave a single squeak for the all clear. The warehouse was pretty normal. A bunch of crates, a few processing areas, everything labelled in a complicated system. At first glance, it was empty. The back door I’d busted opened onto the catwalk I now stood on, which led to an office and then down to the warehouse floor. There wasn’t a single person in sight. I breathed a sigh of relief and slipped my gun away, gesturing for Creon to do a perimeter check. He padded off along the catwalk while I headed to the office. 

<br /><br />

I stepped inside, and was surprised to see that the room was almost identical to my office. There was a desk at the far end, two dinged up couches near the door and three chairs on the close side of the desk.  There was also a box of Poke Balls next to the white flimsy desk. I wandered over and hunkered by it. These weren’t shitty knockoffs like mine. These were Pokémon League Approved Balls, down to the little PLA on the base. There were at least thirty balls in this box. 
<br />
“Jesus, that’s a lot of quality Balls.” I murmured. I’d discovered that thinking out loud normally produced more results than internal contemplation. I made myself snicker. 

<br /><br />

I ran my eyes over the papers on the desk. Order and export forms for a bunch of different Balls. Poke Balls and Great Balls, both of which are legal, and Dusk Balls, Quick Balls and Master Balls; all of which aren’t. So this was some kind of black market PokeBall dealer. Why would someone threaten Audrey Bartlett to keep me away from here? I hadn’t known this place existed before tonight. The sound of my phone ringing made me jump.
<br />
“Hendricks PI, speak and be heard.”
<br />
“It’s Takeshi.”
<br />
“I’m in the middle of a thing right now.”
<br />
“This is important.”
<br />
“And this is a thing.”
<br />
“Hendricks.” He sounded quietly amused.
<br /><br />
“A’right, hit me.” I sat in silence while he explained his important before hanging up. The conversation had left me a little stunned. The lab had tested the RedResin – a kind of… microscopic residue left by Poke Balls when they’re used – found in Devin Western’s apartment and it matched samples from a warehouse the OPL had seized last week. I asked, mouth dry and tongue large, for the address. Takeshi read the address of the building I was standing in. I wasn’t safe. Neither was Audrey. 

<br /><br />

My heart pounded, sweat colouring my brow and my palms. I hurled myself out the back door, whipping my head around, searching for bad guys. My hand curled over the sandalwood grip at my belt. My jaw clenched uncomfortably. I was shaking. Why? 
<br /><br />
I was good at this job. I was used to huge Pokémon and gunmen. Why was I so damn shook up? My stomach tossed. The answer was staring me in the face, eyes quivering in fear, a gun pressed to her side. Some days you start on the back foot and never manage to recover, and the rain keeps pouring until the sun comes up the next day. Thank god it was midnight; maybe my luck would turn.
<br /><br />
A blonde woman with a swirly pixie cut held the weapon against Miss Bartlett. I tried to gather information before I moved, an idea which I implore you to try in your life - you’ll make better decisions. So, basic details. Go.

<br /><br />

Blonde, pixie cut, salon quality hair product with low shine but high hold, making her hair sort of swoop over her scalp. Black jeans, combat boots, tank top with a belt of PokeBalls running diagonal across her chest. Semi-automatic handgun held in her left hand, finger off the trigger, resting on the grip. So she was a professional but didn’t dress like anyone too well off. That wasn’t much to go on. 

<br /><br />
“Mister Hendricks,” the woman declared, making eye contact. Pretty green things they were, lit with confidence.
<br />
“Random stranger with a gun pointed to my potential new girlfriend’s side.” Hah-hah, I’m so funny.
<br />
“Ah. I’d heard about your big mouth, detective.” Okay, so she either she was trying to goad me with my past, or just wasn’t well informed. I’m a Private Investigator thank you, no longer a Detective.
<br />
“Didn’t you get the memo? I’m now a Private Investigator. Maybe I could give you my card?”
<br />
“Enough with the jokes, pirate-man,” barked the pixie-lady, keeping the gun still. An amateur would’ve shoved the gun into Audrey’s side in an attempt to confirm her ability to shoot, but this experienced pixie-lady was smart. She knew that the gun was proof enough of her conviction.
<br />
“Does it really look pirate-y? Everyone keeps saying that. I’m not really sold,” I mused, adjusting my new cloak. She seemed annoyed. Good. Annoyed meant distracted.
“No more jokes or I kill her.”
<br /><br />

I sucked in a deep breath and wiped a bead of sweat from beneath my nose. My fist tightened. The wind toyed with my cloak, tossing Audrey’s hair around. We stood at the back entrance to the warehouse on a side road, the streetlights beating down little ovals of light as if they had known something bad might happen. Side street, midnight, gun pressed to a pretty lady I fancied. This pixie-lady had made a mistake.

<br /><br />
“You’ve made three mistakes.” I stared her in the eye. 
<br />
“I said no jok-” 
<br /><br />
I cut her off, my voice measured and firm. “You threatened my friend, you ambushed me, and you tried to use sex to get to me.” I paused, face blank. I couldn’t see myself, but Takeshi had told me once that my eyes went dark when I was angry. Like the colour dials had turned from blue to grey. 
“All I want is a promise, Mister Hendricks, nothing more. Promise you’ll stay away from this case.”
<br />
“And that makes four,” I whispered. 
<br /><br />
I whirled in a full three-sixty, dropping to one knee while drawing my revolver, cloak concealing my movement. When I slammed my knee into the ground, facing pixie-cut, I fired six shots in perfect succession, a measured pause between each. All four of the lights around us exploded into shards. My final two shots hit pixie-cut in her exposed shoulder. She’d raised her gun at me as I’d turned, and in doing so, had very helpfully provided me with the opening. She cried in pain and I charged her down. I heard a pattering of paws and then the road was lit by brilliant fire, pixie-hair’s haunted face orange and distraught. Creon threw himself against the bad guy and pinned her to the ground, growling into her face, flames glowing on his back. 

<br /><br />

“Good boy.” I said to him, hunkering above her head. To pixie-cut, the whole world was Creon’s face and mine. 
<br />
“Four mistakes is four too many, pixie-cut.” I told her, feeling the weight of my revolver in my palm. She gulped, vocal cords tightening, her pupils dilating.
“So, who do you work for?” She frowned at me, looking angry. 
<br />
“You might’ve been misinformed about my current occupation, but you’ve heard of me. Now you’ve seen what I’m capable of, so don’t mess me around. Tell me what I need.” And, for once, the person I was threatening did as they were told.

<br /><br />

Pixie-cut worked for a thug named Furian, a high-end mobster in the Poke Ball smuggling business. My blonde associate claimed Furian had provided sufficient information about me and my clientele so she was able to invent a case I’d be interested enough to work. The rest was a matter of execution. Then I asked why this fella had wanted me away from the warehouse I didn’t know about, and how it was related to the Devin Western’s apartment. She genuinely had never heard of Mister Western, and confirmed my suspicion that part of the plan was for me to work it all out and come to the warehouse anyway; it was a trap. She did confess, however, her oversight. She hadn’t calculated that I would bring Audrey with me. So I guess that’s something.

<br /><br />

I knocked out pixie-cut and told Takeshi to come pick her up. He arrived with two OPL officers in his car who went about processing blonde-tank-top woman while I walked the warehouse floor with Takeshi. I left Audrey leaning against the squad car in a blanket, her fond smile fresh in my mind. When I asked her if she’d be all right if I chatted to Takeshi, she nodded and said without a smile.
<br />
“Only if I can have a blanket.” I gave her a blanket and she laughed me off, apparently having no faith in the fact that I could produce a shock blanket from a police car.  

<br /><br />
Takeshi lit a cigarette, sucking in the air with a thoughtful grunt.
<br />
“Those things will kill you,” I suggested, trying my best not to sound rude but also attempting to start a conversation at the same time. He hadn’t said a word since we’d started walking.
<br />
“I know. I hope the bullet I’m owed wins the race.” I wasn’t sure what to say. Usually I’d make a joke, but Takeshi looked rough. His hair, which was normally gelled neatly, was poorly combed, and his suit was dirty. I realised it was midnight, and I probably looked worse, but I’d never seen Takeshi this bad.
<br />
“You okay?” I asked hesitantly. He shrugged.
<br />
“Just tired. Get some rest, Hendricks, I will call you in the morning when I know our next move.” We walked back to the parking lot in silence, both thinking to ourselves. I had the feeling there was a big game at play, and that I was already on the back foot. Once I returned Miss Bartlett’s Mons and received a goodnight kiss, I drove home to my two room flat and fell into bed.
