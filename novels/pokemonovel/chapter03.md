I pulled into the gas station, the Golf’s engine cluttering off. I checked my watch. The time was exactly six and I still hadn’t eaten since breakfast, so I figured I’d earned myself a quick feed. My wallet contained six dollars and four cents, enough for some bad tasting, greasy, faux-dinner. I stepped out of the car and shrugged the cloak on, trying to get it to sit right before heading inside. The small service station smelled wholly of deep fryer. I’d eaten here on a few occasions when I lacked time to cook or money for groceries, so I knew what I was in for. So I thought.


<br /><br />


The window of the shop had a dozen posters, none of them very interesting, and all in tacky fonts with stupid pictures. I only realised I’d been hit when my shoulder went through an advertisement for a diet cola, glass exploding around me. 


<br /><br />


Glass tends to break one of two ways. It shatters into big bits, or it disintegrates into little shiny flakes. This window did the first, big chunks digging into my shoulder. I spun onto the lino floor, grabbing at my arm desperately. I had to get the glass out if I had any chance of fighting whatever tossed me through the window. I went to grab the pieces but ended up grabbing at my cloak. Oh. The GarSkin had protected me completely. Neat.


<br /><br />


I got to my feet and rolled my neck, thanking Takeshi under my breath. Wind streamed in through the broken window, curling around my shins, the cloak swirling at my ankles. I turned to the cowering shop keep, a young fella with spots on his face and a phone in his hand.


<br /><br />


“Call the police then stay behind the counter,” I barked, striding through the automatic doors, glass crunching under my boots. The night greeted me with a simper as the doors slid open to reveal a figure. About a foot taller than me, the shape wore a black robe, hood shadowing its features. Seven foot, broad shoulders and probably out to kill me. “Machoke.” I breathed.


<br /><br />


Truth be told, I’ve only fought a Machoke once, and it sent me to the emergency room with a broken arm and three fractured ribs. I stared down this pseudo-hit-man-Mon, trying not to let me hands shake. Two options. Run or fight. Loose a few rounds, head to the Golf and gun it. Stand my ground, wait to see whether the Machoke was trying to rough me or kill me, and then deal with it either way. I didn’t have anything stronger than Umbreon, so it was Bree and I against this wall of stone muscle. My fingers closed around her ball and I realised I’d made my decision. I drew the Pokeball in my left, revolver in my right, and set my boots. 


<br /><br />


“Come on then, what are you waiting for? Not choking, are you?” I challenged, easing the Pokeball to its full size, smiling at my own pun.


<br /><br />


I saw the flash of a bullet and dived to the ground, hands going to my head. A shot punched through the remaining shop window, followed by another. The next bullet ricocheted by my feet, and the fourth shot skimmed my boots. I flung myself up, slotting my gun back in its holster, bolting for the nearest cover, only to release it’d be my Golf. Damn.


<br /><br />


I crouched behind my car and released Bree at my feet. She formed with a quiet purr, eyes wide in anticipation.

<br />

“I got a Machoke and a shooter. I need you to create a distraction so I can take out the shoot, then we’ll deal with Machoke old style.” She gave me an approving head-butt. 

<br />

“On my three.” 


<br /><br />


I counted to three and on the final number, launched myself from around the car, Bree jumping the damn thing to land on the roof, rings articulating her body flashing a brilliant yellow. As I scrambled around the Golf, I raised my gun, taking a guess at where the gunman was shooting from. The shots sounded hollow, from a pistol or low calibre rifle at most, so he’d be close.


<br /><br />


I scanned the area while I moved. There were three cars in the parking lot including mine, and a cloaked Machoke. And a suited figure with a semi-automatic in each hand on the other side of the street. He was too far to hit, and I wasn’t surprised he’d missed me so many times.  I just needed to get around him. A plan started to form in my mind, racing to connect the dots so I could stay alive.

<br /><br />


Bree darted from the roof, rings flashing once and then fizzling out. She almost disappeared when she touched the ground, closing the gap between her and the Machoke in seconds. I’d forgotten how fast Umbreon could be. She launched herself at the Machoke, going for its chest. No one else would’ve noticed, but I’d trained Bree since she was a little’n. Just before she slammed into it, her mouth opened, spewing a shadowy film onto the Machoke’s cloak. The small splatter of shadow ball residue tripled her impact – an old trick she’d developed to knock over her food container. 


<br /><br />


The Machoke stumbled – impressive considering how small Bree was – and four arms burst from beneath its cloak, a huge stoney hand curling around Bree. It tossed Bree in the air, and rammed a fist forward, sending her slamming through the air and into the Golf. My car rocked on its suspension from the force of the blow, a whimper of pain leaving my Bree’s mouth as she rolled to the ground. It wasn’t a Machoke at all. Four arms, weather crest over its brow; it was a Machamp, and a big one. I didn’t have time to think before a lucky bullet slammed into my shoulder, throwing my balance, and my body to the ground. 


<br /><br />


“Crap, that hurt.” I groaned, rubbing the spot where the cloak had protected me once again. Sooner or later, one of those shots was going to hit me somewhere soft and I’d be done. Machamp would crush Bree and I’d be shot in the head.


<br /><br />


I could taste blood, the fall slicing my tongue open. I spat it from my mouth and tried to focus. My lungs burned and my vision was all blurry, but an idea came to me. My plan before had been simple. Have Bree distract the Machoke while I take out the shooter, get his identity or employer, then hot leg it away from the Machoke. That wasn’t going to happen. I’d heard of Machamps – its evolution – punching down mountains before so if I let it tangle with Bree too long, I wasn’t sure what would happen. 


<br /><br />


I lay there for a moment, letting the cloak give me cover and taking a moment to think. An idea started in the back of my head, creeping forward, gaining momentum. I had a plan. And this time, it might even work.


<br /><br />


I launched to my feet, bolting for the shooter, hoping I could get to this guy before I ate a bullet. When I was about five meters away, I stopped, planted my feet, and took the shot. The thug pitched back, head snapping backward, cracking against the wall the shooter had been standing against. Blood drenched the man’s blonde hair as his eyes went wide and he clutched at his chest, sprawling to the ground. 


<br /><br />


I didn’t have time to stop. With a quick glance at the shooter – blonde, six foot, Caucasian male, early-twenties – I whirled, cloak billowing. I squeezed off my revolver as I ran, all five bullets hitting the Machamp’s back. They ricocheted off the Pokemon’s back. It didn’t do any damage, but the brute turned toward me, four arms clenched in anger. I had wanted to get its attention, but I realised my error while I stood, staring into its eyes. It was damn angry.


<br /><br />


I had to break the bulletproof skin on its face and before going for a head shot. It was my only hope to get away alive. Bree could get through that skin if she coated her teeth in dark matter, but I’d need to distract the Machamp to get in close. Which meant putting myself in front of the thing and not getting killed.

<br />

“Bree, Crunch on its crest on my mark!” I yelled, bolting toward the Machamp. I didn’t have time to reload, so it was time to improvise. I pulled bullet around from my belt and flipped the cap off, pouring a small amount of gunpowder into my palm. I closed my fist over the stuff as I scooped up a piece of metal pipe from the sidewalk, piling on the speed. 


<br /><br />


It lunged for me, two arms barrelling toward my face. I ducked around to the right, only to see another huge fist about a finger’s width from my chin. My left hand jack-hammered up and I flung the powder at its face. The creature stumbled back, growling in surprise. I capitalized, stepping forward and throwing my weight as I struck with the pipe, slamming the Machamp’s chin in an uppercut. 


<br /><br />

<br /><br />


The weapon warped around its face and its four over-sized arms rubbed at its eyes furiously, trying to get rid of the black powder while dealing with the thumping headache I’d just caused.


<br /><br />

<br /><br />


“Now.” I yelled, throwing myself away from the flailing Machamp and onto my back, the cloak protecting me while I hit the ground. 


<br /><br />


Umbreon leapt over me, streams of black energy dripping from its teeth. I watched her shoot through the air and I started loading my revolver, slipping three rounds into the gun quickly as my hands could allow. One of the bullets went spinning away but the other two clicked in perfectly. I sat up just in time to see Bree rip Machamp’s face open, blood mixed with black in spray of mist, before I raising the gun and aiming in, squeezing out two bullets with a heartbeat in-between. The first skimmed off Machamp’s cheek, but the second landed right in its temple, the bloodied soft spot Umbreon had torn open. The bullet entered with a zip and a squelch, and before the Machamp had fallen over, Bree hit the ground and shredded her teeth across the Machamp’s left foot. It crashed to the ground, its left foot now hanging from Bree’s red maw, tendrils of muscle and bits of sinew draped around the ankle bone. Blood erupted from the missing limb and poured from the creature’s forehead, as it thrashed, the huge muscular creature convulsing and pitching, howling in pain. I watched it bleed out.


<br /><br />


I took pictures of the dead guy and the Machamp with my phone – a few of each, as long as I could force myself to. Then I got in the Golf, called the police, and drove to Miss Bartlett’s address in silence, my head spinning. The adrenalin eventually left me feeling hungry and tired, hands lead on the wheel. My head pounded absently. That was a close call. People had tried to kill me a lot in the past, but I’d never gone up against anything that big before. I’d been lucky. Really damn lucky. I’d been considering it for a while, but the uneasy weight of a Machamp hit man on my shoulders made the necessity for more firepower pressing.
