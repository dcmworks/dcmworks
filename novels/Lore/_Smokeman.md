Tends to be under a blanket of stars. So far away from everything and all folk, that you can barely hear yourself breath without the echo catching up. Normally you wouldn’t notice, I’d guess. Most seem to think it ain’t real. Just one of them – uh – one of them wives’ tails or urban stories, the kind decent fellas tell ‘round the fire during hot summer nights. To scare the kids mostly. I dun’t know, I ain’t gon’ say one way or the t’other, just know this; I ain’t gonn’ say whether I know or don’t, but I seen ‘im. I ain’t ever goin’ that place again.
<br /><br />

They say it happens, like most ghost-stories, on a road in the desert. Usually somewhere in Sinnoh along highway two-two-eight. Big, empty space that one. Just you and you’re engin’, maybe your mutt, for hours on end. Nothin’ but the whizzin’ of other folk going on the other way to keep ya company. God forsaken places like that, stories and what like this, makes me wonder if we shouldn’t ever have ventured yonder. Seems ill-fated. 

<br /><br />

People always makin’ up stories, so I did some diggin’. Turns out, the first few folk to go missin’ and happen upon such extra-ordinary events was just outside violet city. The scorched earth out there is a desert like no other. For miles, a blackened sand-tomb for the long dead winged-monsters of this world. I mean, ain’t like the place ain’t creepy enough durin’ the day. It’ll get ya haunches all a-raised. The sand taste of bones out there. Ain’t nothin’ round. Maybe they needed the bathroom, but ain’t no reststop. Maybe they was tired. Maybe they was out of fuel. Maybe they saw someone at the side of the road, under that blanket of stars. Maybe they saw someone they didn’t like the look of. Out there, with nothin’ but you an the universe, you’d be surprised what you see. 

<br /><br />

Some say the valley is haunted by the presence of the ol’ dragons, small critters and large alike, exactin’ they’re vengeance upon the world. Wiser folk know better. Few score back, Franklin from the down the gas station sayed that those fellas, the kind who thank it was them ghosts, they don’t know. He reckoned that over there, in that desert built upon a fiery-tomb, he reckoned they was somethin’ else at work. Some vengeful spirit – prayin’ and waitin’. Watchin’.

<br /><br />

They say it starts like that. All of ‘em. Like you’re being watched. A pair of eyeballs on you from the endless blackness around ya. Goin’ on for miles. Nothin’ but empty, and yet you still got those hairs on the back of ya neck, up on the ends, raised like you got a fella watchin’ your back. And you’re drivin’ along and you try to forget. But then, eventually, because you got to or you think you got to, you ain’t drivin’ no more.

<br /><br />

There was this woman. Who got herself an encounter as they calls it, the wiser folk. I dun’t know her name, but I surely tell you her story, seein’ as that’s why you listen. 
<br /><br />
She’s drivin’ up to see her pops. Her ol’ man he’s—he’s sick you see. Got somethin’ eatin’ him from the inside, ain’t got too long left in this life. So after she gets the call, she gets herself up out of bed, kisses her husband goodbye and hops on in that car. She ain’t no fool, she’s gotsta drive from Violet City all the ways over to Goldenrod. Fastest way is through that nine hour empty, so for folk like her in a rush, it makes all the sense in the world. Can’t say I completely agree with her, anyhow, she’s drivin’ along. 
<br /><br />

Got the radio going, I guess, some nice little music to keep her company. I suppose what she first notice would be that kind of… that little tickle. The instinct we kept from the ol’ days when was nothin’ but covered in hair, she feels it flair’n up. That feelin’ of being watched. Like somebody is peeking at her from that vast, impossible darkness. All you got in the world is twenty-feet forward of yer car and the other folk whizzin’ by pretty regular-like. But she starts to realise, very slowly, then all at once, that there ain’t no more cars comin’ the other ways. Ain’t nothin’. 
<br /><br />

She heard it first, so they says. A kind of wind-like, somethin’ on the edge of your ear that you can’t quite get right, sort-a there but not. I’m not the kind for imaginin’s but this lady drivin’ on heard a wind, she’s thinkin’ there’s a breeze rollin’ in maybe, or the radio ain’t workin’ quite right. So she’s musin’ on it and wonderin’, then she looks down and sees that she’s runnin’ on out of fuel. That little swingin’ dial is in the red. She’d left in such a hurry she didn’t even consider it I’d guess, but she needed some gas. Sun wasn’t half up yet, so she had a long ways to go befores anywhere would sell her any kind of anythin’. 
<br /><br />

Her eyes kept on goin’ back to that there little dial. I’d go so far as to say she started to breath a little heavier, ‘n’ even start to worry proper. No one around for miles out there, just you and the sand made of bones. So she keeps checkin’ and checkin’. For an hour she drives on like this, ‘fraid she’s gonna come rollin’ to a halt, forgettin’ she ain’t seen a soul for a-while. That wind is there too, all whistlin’, under the skin, givin’ you a kind of nervous you only get at night. She’s all a-scared now, proper, ain’t a thing like it. Dark for miles, emptiness all ‘round, just the other cars whizzin’ by that ain’t comin’ by no more.
<br /><br />

I’m thinkin’ it’s deep, you know, that fear. Right in your veins waitin’ for cold times when someone’s watching. The little hairs on the back of her neck, they’re all standin’ up like she’s the star of a secret audition. With the wind on the radio and that little feelin’, and maybe it was the fuel gauge dialin’ on down, but she’s getting nervous. Ain’t no cell phone signal out this far though, no one to call but the gods and the stars.  No cars, no one to call and she’s gettin’ the sinkin’ feelin’, like you made a mistake you just don’t know it yet. 

<br /><br />

Anyhow, she’s looking down at the fuel and back up then bam, somethin’ jumps in front of the car all ‘sudden and blurred-like. She’s jams the brakes and spins, world whippin’ by, skiddin’ herself off the road. The radio goes louder’n with that whistle, the wind, and she ain’t so sure she’s okay. Our woman restarts her vehicle, white knuckles on the keys, the engine tickin’ over, her heart in her throat – I’ll say it like it is, don’t you worry ‘bout that, won’t make nothin’ up, sir –  and then she hears it. A voice in that wind, you know. Whisperin’. Like bits of smoke from under the front door of your burnin’ house, the voice drips in through the radio, poolin’ in her lap and makin’ her go faster. The engine kicks in and she puts her foot right on down, swervin’ ont’a the road. ‘Course, even when your breathin’ and your heart’s-a pumpin’, you check over ya shoulder. So she’s looks back, seein’ two pairs of red, smoulerin’ eyes, burnin’ through her soul, scorchin’ right through her into the heart of thangs. Then there was a horn and a pair of lights flashin’ at her, and the woman went and got herself in a smash-up. Collected by one of them fancy new trucks, an’ I’ll say she went to the same hospital as her dear old pa.

<br /><br />

There were more though – more like you wouldn’t believe me mister. I can’t quantify or explain, but I’ll say it was somethin’. Couples bein’ chased down that long stretch of road, voice on the wind, burnin’ eyes. And they couldn’t tell with that first one, but the others they could. Burns and marks on the cars of those folk, even the ones that ain’t stopped, like someone put a fire’d hand on the car. Always the shape of a hand, thin-demon-like fingers on them. I can’t explain it, sir. Not few months back, I was takin’ myself down that road to fetch m’self, drivin’ it like I knew what was comin’, full tank of gas and my wits, you know. Ready for this, thing, or likely whatever was makin’ folk think it was real. Didn’t hear me no wind, no voices or the like. But I’ll say – and with some certaintly given I ain’t the smartest fella – that I saw him. I did. Standin’ there, fella in faded red clothes, skin cracked and black’ed, like he’d been all cooked up too long, them eyes burnin’ through me as I drove past. Couldn’t hardly shake the feelin’ of someone ready to pounce, waitin’ like a lion in the grass. I didn’t hear nothin’ ‘til then. I saw right into that thing, whatever in the god-damn-hell that thing was, all glowin’ and burnin’ always burnin’ – through me and in me and I still hear that voice, the whisper, when I sleep. Small-like, quiet, just one voice, in the back of my head and I can’t get it out. I dun’t know, maybe it’s me, not sure, but all I hear when I close my eyes is that voice, and I see those eyes.
<br /><br />

I dun’t know if he’s real, but I hear the words whispered to me every night. And I see those eyes and I still got that hand on my car. Smokeman. Smokeman. 
<br /><br />
Smokeman chasin’ me.
<br />
Smokeman watchin’ me.
<br />
Smokeman catchin’ me.
<br /><br />

Burnin’
