<br /><br />

The phone rang at ten past two, about an hour after Miss Bartlett left. I’d spent the time reading through some of the Pokémon League’s files on network Pokémon regarding past disappearances. I hadn’t found anything useful yet, so the phone ringing was a welcome distraction. I picked up the handset and did my usual intro. 
<br />
“Hendricks PI, what can I do for you?” 
<br />
“Hey, it’s me.” Takeshi’s gravelly voice made the handset crackle with static. 

<br /><br />

Brock Takeshi is my liaison with the Department of Necessities, the division I contract with on occasion. They specialise in Mon related crime, working under the OPL, and subsequently falling under the League’s jurisdiction. 
<br />
“Ah, protector of the peace and enforcer of scary looking officers. What can I do for you? Some work, I hope?” The line was silent for a few moments. Takeshi had never appreciated my humour. 
<br />
“I got a body and a trashed apartment block. We need you.” 

<br /><br />

He gave me the address, which I jotted down, making a mental note of how to drive there. It was an apartment block downtown, part of the more recent redevelopments. 
<br />
“Anything else I should know?” I asked evenly, realising Takeshi sounded… off.
<br /> 
“It’s messy.” With a click, the line went dead. I sat back in my chair for a few moments, considering things. Miss Bartlett would have to wait, I was needed elsewhere. 

<br /><br />

It wasn’t too cold, so I slipped on my going-out-clothes and made for the door. While it offended the eyes and often seemed to physically hurt some folk, most days I couldn’t resist the allure of a Hawaiian over shirt. Today was one of those days. 

<br /><br />

If the crime scene was in bad shape, I’d need some decent eyes and maybe even an arson inspector. I don’t know why I spent so long standing by the PC by the door, I only owned four Mons anyway. I hit the withdraw key and four balls materialised in the drop tray. Collecting my Mons, I was, once again, reminded how short I was on cash. The balls themselves were crappy rip offs, probably made in one of those Sinnoh sweat shops. They worked, though. I clipped the balls to my belt and headed into the afternoon. 

<br /><br />

I drove my beat up Volkswagen – an elderly Golf – the fifteen minutes to the address Takeshi had provided. I parked neatly into a spot next to a police cruiser and headed for the yellow tape. The first thing I noticed, beyond the shuffling cops and bewildered bystanders, was the state of the building. It wasn’t on fire, but the middle three floors looked scorched. It was as if some storm had whipped through the building and set it ablaze, and then another gust of wind had carried the flames away. I stared at it for a moment, trying to decide where the fire had started. It was almost impossible, given the floors hadn’t collapsed. I wasn’t even sure where the fire had been the hottest. Brock had been right to call me. No natural fire leaves the rest of the building untouched. 

<br /><br />

I approached the yellow police tape, ID badge clipped to my loud blue and yellow shirt, and was waved through. I asked the OPL officer for Brock and he gestured to a huddle of officers. When I got a little closer, they were all gathered around the fifty-something head of the Organisation of Prenatural Legislation, Brock Takeshi. Takeshi was built like a wall - all refined muscle, tan, and in his early fifties, the first signs of age showed on his east-Asian face as smile lines. As I was within earshot, I understood why the group had gathered. A civilian had entered the building and altered the crime scene. That was unfortunate, and was going to make my life just a bit more difficult. The officers should’ve known better. I hovered at the back, and when he was done, Takeshi walked over, speaking to me in muted tones. 

<br />

“Thanks for coming.” 
<br />
“S’okay, you were right to call. That fire isn’t natural.” 
<br />
“Agreed. Shall we?” He suggested. 

<br /><br />

I followed him into the building without a word, Takeshi’s silence a little concerning. Though he wasn’t usually chatty, Takeshi would normally have more to say than just hello. I’d only worked with the OPL for a year, so it wasn’t like Takeshi was my best friend, but he did seem off. My guess was that whatever happened in the apartment had been really bad. We made our way to the fourth floor of the building via the charred fire escape – the irony wasn’t lost on me, by the way, because I know you just rolled your eyes – and into apartment number three-one-four, announced by blackened letters on a blackened door. Takeshi led me inside. 

<br /><br />

I’d been working crime scenes since I got out of university, so the mundane blood and gore didn’t bother me. When I was transferred to OPL from the regular forensic unit I contracted with, I thought I was ready. Stepping into the living room of this burned out apartment, I was reminded of my naiveté. 

<br /><br />

“Our deceased is Devin Western," Takeshi began. "He turned twenty-one last March. Tiffany Banks from across the hall called the police to report the fire. At ten o’clock this morning, she heard yelling from Devin’s room, and moved across the hall to see if Mister Western was okay. When she entered the hallway, she claims to have seen a green blur, followed by a black man wearing a tan overcoat but thought little of it, it seems. She knocked on the door, and the apartment burst into flames. Tiffany then rung the fire alarm and fled for the fire escape, calling the fire department and police at… six past ten.” 

<br /><br />

I absorbed the information and set about the crime scene, my entire universe limited to Devin Western’s apartment. 


<br /><br />

The apartment was only two rooms, a living room with an ikea kitchenette and a bedroom. I’d seen apartments burned down before, but this was different. The walls were black, the floors were covered in scorched furniture, but there wasn’t evidence of the usual decay caused by slow fires. No, this had been hot. Really hot. It hadn’t burned the building per se, rather, it’d moved through the room with speed, destroying any evidence but leaving the building in one piece. This would’ve taken a Pokémon with precision and training, probably an asset used for similar crimes in the past. 

<br /><br />

The burn marks showed a clear point of origin to the right of the door, suggesting the Mon had produced the blaze from about my knee height with its back to the exit. There was a distinct cone seared onto the floor, reconfirming the origin of the breath attack. I followed the blast until I reached the body. In the middle of the room in the foetal position, was our victim. Mister Devin Western was very dead. 
<br /><br />

He hadn’t been reduced to ash or char. His skin was blackened and tight, as if he’d been mummified in flames. I hunkered by his scorched body. 
<br />
“He wasn’t killed by the fire, was he?” I asked, hoping to bounce an idea off Takeshi. 
<br />
“No. The lacerations on his chest ended his life before the fire was started. Can you identify a Pokémon, or do you think it was a weapon?” 
<br /><br />

There were seven – no eight – diagonal cuts across the man’s upper torso. They were from a clean blade, but seemed hurried and none were perfectly straight. That ruled out any blade Pokémon, and I wasn’t certain, but the frequency of the strokes almost definitely excluded human weapons as well, leaning me toward claws. 
<br />
“This was definitely a Pokémon hit. One to kill the target with claws, I think, another to wipe clean prints and any traces of skin or hair.” Takeshi nodded. 
<br />
“This tells us two things,” I continued, pacing about the room. 
<br />
“First, our killer must have owned a well-trained fire Pokémon – probably something that’d been used for jobs like this before, or at least, trained properly – and second, whoever did this had a careful plan that involved cleaning up after themselves. This isn’t some second-rate hit or a murder of passion. Western’s death was the work of a professional, which doesn’t exclude family members or friends as culprits, just means they didn’t do the dirty work themselves. Did our victim have any ties to Giovanni or his team?” Takeshi shook his head and studied the body absently. 

<br /><br />

I did some thinking of my own. We lived in Geespoke city, a bustling metropolis in the heart of the Johto region, and the guy who ran every damn crime show is Giovanni. Or… well, he used to. Sort of. He’d been imprisoned by the Pokémon League ten years ago, but in the last two months he had been let out on good behaviour. He’s still under surveillance, but we’re all convinced he’d be back in action by now. He always seemed to have a finger in every damn illegal pie, so I’d thought it natural to assume a hit with this sophistication was his doing. 

<br /><br />

“Any criminal record of our deceased? Not an in-gang hit?” 
<br />
“Nope,” Takeshi responded, shaking his head, “This guy was clean. Didn’t even have a parking ticket to his name.” 
<br />
“Crap,” I said. Takeshi nodded. 
<br />
“Indeed.” He let me think for a minute or two before venturing to interrupt my thoughts. 
<br /><br />


“Ideas?” He asked. 
<br />
“Not yet, give me ten minutes.” Then I set about doing what I do best. 
<br /><br />
I slipped the pinkie-sized ball from my belt and eased in the button, the Poke ball expanding to its full size. I hit the button again but nothing happened. On my fifth press, the ball snapped open, a fork of red lightning snaking to the ground with a crackle. The sparks coalesced into the shape of a cat. Umbreon materialised at my feet, purring in a split voice - one low and dark, the other cat-like and cute. 
<br />
“I still find her discomforting,” Takeshi noted. 

<br /><br />

I smiled to myself. That’s why I like Bree. She’s creepy as hell, has some powerful dark moves, her rings are a great mag-light and she can sense… uh… how do I explain? She can sense residual emotions, I suppose, and that helps me gauge motive when someone’s destroyed any physical evidence. 
<br />
“Do we have to go outside?” Takeshi asked, already knowing the answer. 
<br />
“Yep, she needs the room.” He nodded and I followed him out. 

<br /><br />

We strolled outside to the police cruiser with the lage thermos in the trunk.I made myself a bitter coffee and Takeshi pulled out a smoke. A Styrofoam cup of coffee in my hands and a lit cigarette in his, we ambled around the parking lot. I sipped tentatively. 
<br />
“Oh god,” I muttered. 
<br />
“Hm?” He grunted in response. 
<br />
“This coffee is terrible.” I said, taking another gulp. He smiled wryly. Eventually, Takeshi led me toward his ancient Mustang. His vintage muscle car was bumblebee yellow, but I’d made the mistake of making a crack about its bombastic flare a few months back, and he hadn’t spoken to me for a week. 

<br /><br />
I waited patiently while he popped the trunk. He produced a blue duffel bag, handing it over by the comfy handle. I took the bag without a word. 
<br />
“To replace Hawaii.” I stared at him, mouth hung comically open. 
<br />
“Takeshi,” I began indignantly. 
<br />
“Hendricks?” 
<br />
“Do you have a problem with the trendy yet retro Hawaiian shirts?” He nodded, a mischievous grin touching the edge of his lips. 
<br />
“It’s winter soon anyway, so I got you something. An old souvenir I want you to have. From my glory days.” I opened the bag to see a lot of… leather, I think? 

<br /><br />

I pulled out a long coat from the bag. It was about my height, fashioned from some hardened brown leather. It had no sleeves, which was odd, but the collar had a buckle. I slipped it on, fastening the belt-like buckle across my collarbone, the coat itself flowing behind me. It was more a cloak with shoulders. 

<br /><br />

“Looks good.” 
<br />
“I feel like a pirate,” I said quietly. Unsurprisingly, Takeshi paid my words no heed. 
<br />
“I fashioned this cloak from the remnants of Claire Ibuki’s Garchomp during the Second Indigo Incursion. This cloak has served me well. It has stopped bullets, and saved me from far worse.”
I ran my hands over it, the Garchomp leather smooth under my palm. It was a beautiful cloak. 
<br />
“Thank you.” 
<br />
I offered my hand, and Takeshi shook it firmly, not saying another word until we re-entered the apartment. 

<br /><br />

I stepped inside, Bree meowing and rubbing against my leg. I offered her a quick pet before spreading my fingers, ten options for her to pick from. Nine criminal motives for each finger, and my right ring finger for anything not on the list. She inspected my digits with her usual suspicion. After a few passes, her purple tongue ran over my right ring finger. 
<br />
“Bree says our bad guy was incredibly calm and collected, definitely no passion.” 
<br />
“So a professional hit?” 
<br />
“My first guess is yeah, probably. But-” He cut me off. 
<br />
“I know. We have to entertain other possibilities, this is just an estimation.” 
<br />
I was reminded again why I enjoy working with Takeshi. He gets things done, doesn’t forget and knows how to do his job. 

<br /><br />

“Where do we start?” I asked. 
<br />
“I’m not sure for today, I need to do some research and wait for forensics to get back to me.” 
<br />
“Okay, call me on my cell when you’ve got our next move.” With that, I headed outside, thankful of the new cloak as the wind kicked up a fuss.
